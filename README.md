# Event Support App
###### Repository made during the semester, front-end side only by myself.
A very simple application for creating, managing and getting informations about events.
Project is still in development, after the end of project classes.


In general, project was made by three persons during the semester, by polish students - that's why it is in polish. 
It is in mind for reenactment group, which needs to organise themselves and all neccesary equipment for an event. 
It the app you can make secure login, add, edit, delete events, register for such events. After registration it is possible to 
fill your user data with all neccesary information, like car combustion, capacity, your availability.

Front-end was made using such technologies:
##### ReactJS, react-bootstrap, lodash, react-datepicker, react-router, axios, jwt tokens, moment

## How to run this app?

### Backend server

For the purpose of the project there was a all backend background made in Java environment, that is not my work, so I don't share this. 
I hope to make some mocked date to show the usabillity of the app.

### Frontend server

#### You will need:
* Node.js
* Visual Studio Code - recommended
* Some terminal - Cmder recommended

#### Steps to run:
* Go to *$\event-support-app-frontside\event-support-app* folder
* Open terminal in this folder (it is important to make *npm* commands in the same folder as *package.json* file)
* Run *npm i* command, and wait until instalation ends
* Run *npm start*
* This should open your browser and open the application on the localhost server, port 3000 (http://localhost:3000)
